The great thing about GitHub is that it also lets you create and host your own webpage. \r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to go to GitHub and create an account. There are two types of webpages you can create on GitHub.  The first is the User or Organisation page, which is basically like a home page - (create repository after your user name e.g.  **www.debbiediscovers.github.io**). The second is what they call a project page, or gh-pages, (create a repository which can be called whatever you like e.g. Blog or Website or Your Cat's Name.)\r\n\r\n##The Easy Way\r\n\r\nYou can *do it the easy way* by using GitHub's automatic page generator, that allows you to makes beautiful, designer webpages with one click without any code. After creating you repository, click on Settings (lower left corner) and you will see the automatic page generator function. Simply follow the instructions and select from a range of stylish templates. Super easy, and pretty neat. *Note that GitHub uses Markdown, which is similar to html but much simpler.*\r\n\r\n##The Half and Half Way\r\n\r\nTo use a couple of built-in shortcuts, first download GitHub for Mac or Windows. Then create a repository (select public and initialise it by creating a README file).  Go to the bottom left, and click on Clone on desktop. \r\n\r\n##The Hard-Core Coders Way\r\n\r\nYou will need to use Terminal for this, but it's not actually that hard. There are only 5 or 6 Git commands to remember, and after a few tries, you will get the hang of it. After creating your user repository on GitHub, clone the directory in your desktop.  To do this, click on the https://github.debbiediscovers/debbiediscovers.github.io link on the lower right hand side of the web page. Go back to terminal and use the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.debbiediscovers/debbiediscovers.github.io\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a directory in your hard drive. Then, create an index.html file for your web page. You can either create it via a text editor like notepad or text wrangler and drop the file in the Github folder that you just created, or you can use the terminal commands touch index.html to create the file and then vim or nano index.html to edit it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ touch index.html\r\n$ vim index.html\r\n```\r\nIf in Vim, create the HTML document and use bootstrap CDN's ready made styling sheets by adding the stylesheets in your header, and the script at the bottom of the body.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  <title> DEBBIE DISCOVERS GITHUB </title>\r\n  <!-- Add some style to your site, see http://getbootstrap.com for details -->\r\n  <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS --\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\r\n  <!-- Optional theme -->\r\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css\">\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<title> DEBBIE DISCOVERS GITHUB </title>\r\n<html>\r\n<body>\r\n<h1> Debbie Discovers Github </h1>\r\n<h2> Use Github Geek to make Websites Chic </h2>\r\n\r\n<!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->\r\n<script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\nAdd your own styling, then to upload the file onto Git, execute Git's Add, Commit and Push commands (the way I think about it is like this - if you want to insert a picture, you first have to select it, open it then insert it.  Similarly, in Git, you have to Add it, Commit it then Push it).\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\r\ngit push -u origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd there you go! \r\n\r\nYou can even add your own custom domain to your website.  In order to do so, create a CNAME file with the custom domain (without the www) as text.  Add,  commit, push. \r\n\r\nWait for 30 minutes and you will have your very own webpage hosted on Git, beautifully styled on your own custom domain. \r\n\r\nNote: If you use gh-pages instead of your User repository, you will ned to \"checkout\" i.e. create the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nDebbie\r\nNote: I did it all 3 ways \r\n\r\nNext: See my [Disney Site] (http://debbiediscovers.github.io/disney/)","google":"UA-73113825-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
